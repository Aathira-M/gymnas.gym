        <h2>Our Gyms All around the world</h2>

        <p>Nearly two thirds of adults in the United States who make New Year's resolutions have set fitness goals as part of their resolution. Of those, 73 percent gave up before meeting their goal, according to a recent online study conducted by Harris Interactive on behalf of GymNas.com in November 2012. Offering workout programs and nutritional advice to help people stay on track toward achieving their fitness resolutions, GymNas.com and Dymatize Nutrition are kicking off registration for their 2013 $100,000 Transformation Challenge.
          Time, Difficulty Following a Program among the Top Reasons People Give Up
          Whether aiming to lose weight, get fit, or train for an athletic event, simply setting a resolution doesn't guarantee success. On average, people who have set fitness resolutions say they have given up on them four times in the past, and cited a number of stumbling blocks when it comes to achieving their fitness goals:          
           </p><br>

        <p>42 percent say it's too difficult to follow a diet or workout regimen
            38 percent say it's too hard to get back on track once they fall off
            36 percent say it's hard to find time
            Nearly half of those who gave up before reaching their fitness resolution goal did so within six weeks or less.
            One in four Americans say they would post a New Year's resolution about fitness on a social network this year. Eleven percent of those who have fitness goals say that they seek fitness advice via social networks, while 32 percent say that following someone who is physically fit - a friend, family member or trainer - via a social network would help them stay motivated to achieve their goals.Most social networks, however, are not built to track fitness programs and progress. People who sign up for the $100,000 Transformation Challenge will become members of GymNas, which has more than 1.5 million members who connect with one another for motivation, tips, encouragement and advice. The platform includes a mobile app and a personal calendar, making it easy for contestants to track their workouts and progress toward their goals.
        </p><br>

       <p> In the past year, members of GymNas who were aiming to lose weight have lost 823,066 pounds, and more than 4,500 people moved from obesity to a healthy weight based on percentage of body fat.
          "One of the things that trips people up when it comes to getting fit is that it's difficult to find that perfect balance of nutrition, exercise and supplementation," said Ryan DeLuca, CEO of GymNas.com.
        </p><br>

     <p>"We created this Challenge three years ago as a way to help people get started and to put those pieces together. It has changed lives, and we are excited
        to see the transformations this New Year brings."
